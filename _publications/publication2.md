title: "Learning Inconsistent Preferences with Kernel Methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/LIPKM
excerpt: "We propose a probabilistic kernel approach for preferential learning from pairwise duelling data using Gaussian Processes. Different from previous methods, we do not impose a total order on the item space, hence can capture more expressive latent preferential structures such as inconsistent preferences and clusters of comparable items."
