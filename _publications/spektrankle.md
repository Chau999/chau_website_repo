excerpt: "
We consider spectral approaches to the problem of ranking n players given their incomplete and noisy pairwise comparisons, but revisit this classical problem in light of player covariate information. We propose three spectral ranking methods that incorporate player covariates and are based on seriation, low-rank assumption and canonical correlation, respectively. Extensive numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed methods compare favorably to existing state-of-the-art covariate-based ranking algorithms. <br/> <br/><img src='/assets/images/duel-icon-12.jpg' height=300>"

### TL;DR
We extend classical covariate-free spectral ranking methods to incorporate item covariates using kernel methods.

### Abstract
We consider spectral approaches to the problem of ranking n players given their incomplete and noisy pairwise comparisons, but revisit this classical problem in light of player covariate information. We propose three spectral ranking methods that incorporate player covariates and are based on seriation, low-rank assumption and canonical correlation, respectively. Extensive numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed methods compare favorably to existing state-of-the-art covariate-based ranking algorithms.
