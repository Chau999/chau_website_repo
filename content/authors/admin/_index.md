Hello! I am Siu Lun Chau and my friends call me Alan. I am a final year DPhil student in the [Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). Before my DPhil, I did my Masters and Undergraduate in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Oxford as well. I have previously interned at Amazon London and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.

For my research, I mainly work on developing trustworthy Machine Learning techniques through kernel methods and Gaussian processes. I have also worked on broader areas of machine learning including causal inference and econometrics, ranking, preference learning, large scale kernel methods, and graph learning.

I also enjoy deploying my research to the industry as a freelance ML consultant, as the variety of projects and clients I work with in turn link back into my research, inspiring me with new ideas.
