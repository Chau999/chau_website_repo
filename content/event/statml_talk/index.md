summary: I presented a variety of model specific SHAP algorithms including my recent contribution RKHS-SHAP.  
abstract: "In this talk we will highlight some recent advancements in using Shapley Values as model interpretability tools. In particular, we will go into model-specific SV methods, such as Linear SHAP for linear models, TreeSHAP for tree models, DeepSHAP for deep models and introduce the latest member to the family â€” RKHS-SHAP for kernel methods. By analysing Shapley values from a functional perspective, RKHS-SHAP can efficiently compute both interventional and Observational Shapley Values using kernel mean embeddings of distributions, thus avoiding density estimation and sampling as most other methods rely on. We also propose a Shapley regulariser based on RKHS-SHAP that allows learning while controlling the level of specific feature contributions to the model. We demonstrate that the Shapley regulariser enables learning which is robust to covariate shift of a given feature and fair learning which controls the Shapley values of sensitive features. "
