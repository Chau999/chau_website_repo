Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Alan. I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at [The University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) working with [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). I am always fascinated by how mathematics and statistics along with data, can be used to unlock new problems and new solutions in this information era. This is why in my research, I focus on intersections of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning domains such as Explainable AI, Statistical Downscaling, Graph Learning, Causal Inference and Ranking. 

I also enjoy applying the latest development in AI research and data science to the industry as a free lance consultant.
