Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

<div style="text-align: right">  Hi, I'm Alan. I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at [The University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) working with [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). I believe mathematics and statistics can unlock new solutions to this ever-evolving and challenging data-centric era. This also motivates my research interests: focusing on the intersection of Kernel Methods with a variety of ML domains such as Explainable AI, Statistical Downscaling, Graph Learning, Causal Inference and Ranking. 

I also enjoy bringing the latest development in AI research and data science to the industry as a freelance ML consultant. I designed the machine learning model behind [giniPredict](https://www.gini.co) which allows business to access powerful explainable forecasting technology with a simple Google sheet interface. I had also worked with [Crop4Sight](https://crop4sight.com) in delivering a potato crop management software that forecast "saleable" crop yield for better returns. The variety of projects and clients I worked with always inspires me with new research ideas.

When I am not working, you'd probably find me in the gym or reading a book at some random local cafe. I also enjoy singing, playing guitar and combative sports such as boxing and karate. I recently passed the CSP Brewing Foundation exam so I guess I'm also a barista now.
