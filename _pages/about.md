Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Alan. I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning (ML) at [The University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) working with [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). I believe that mathematics and statistics can unlock new problems and new solutions for this challenging data-centric era. This also motivates my research interests: focusing on the intersection of Kernel Methods with a variety of ML domains such as Explainable AI, Statistical Downscaling, Graph Learning, Causal Inference and Ranking. 

I also enjoy bringing the latest development in AI research and data science to the industry as a freelance consultant. The variety of projects and clients I worked with always sparkles new ideas for my research.

When I am not working, you'd most probably find me in the gym or reading a book at some random local cafe.
